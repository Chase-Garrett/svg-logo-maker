  Clone the repository, once in the directory run "npm i" to install the dependencies.
  ## Usage
  After the repository has been cloned and the dependencies installed you can run the application from the terminal while in the project directory by using the command "node index.js" or "npm start". The tool will then ask you for the 3 characters you would like on the logo, followed by the text color, shape you want the logo to be, and color you want the shape to be in your logo. Once complete the program will exit automatically and the svg file will be saved to the output directory.
